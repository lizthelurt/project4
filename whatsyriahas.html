<h1> Statements From The Victims </h1>
<p>“One of the barrel bombs fell through a shaft in their home, 
filling the ventilation with chlorine as it broke open. 
Their basement became a makeshift gas chamber.”
Dr Mohamed Tennari 32 years old, Idlib [as told to Syrian American Medical Society] </p>

<p>“I was captured by the police and put in prison for 22 days. 
I was tortured and I saw children dying. I’ve got scars on my feet
, chest and back. There were hundreds of us in prison –
 I was in a big cell with the other children. 
 The youngest ones were nine or ten, they had been captured. I was beaten up every day, and they used electricity too.”
Moussa, 15, [as told to Save The Children]</p>

<p>“The more I screamed and cried, the more he was aroused. After he finished [molesting me], he kept beating me on my feet. 
I fell down on the ground. He kicked me with his boots. For seven days, I couldn’t walk on my feet.”
Layla, 21 years old imprisoned by the Syrian Government, [as told to Humans Right Watch]
